(7) Additional test notes 

- All tests segfault
-----

-----
(8) Code inspection

- not checking for NULL pointer after all mallocs
- in create_list you should use strcpy to set prt->str.  Currently you're just reassigning the pointer to str (so you're mallocing but never using that memory)
- good code organization
- No free() in code so would result in memory leak if it ran

GRADE:
D
